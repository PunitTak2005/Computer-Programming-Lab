Preprocessor directives are commands that instruct the C preprocessor to perform specific tasks before the code is compiled. They often start with a '#' symbol and are used for tasks like including header files, defining constants, and conditional compilation. #include, #define, and #ifdef are some common examples. Mastery of preprocessor directives is key to managing code organization and flexibility.
