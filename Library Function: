Library Function:- Library functions are built-in functions that are grouped together and placed in a common location called library. Each function here performs a specific operation. We can use this library functions to get the pre-defined output. All C standard library functions are declared by using many header files.

Example:-

pow(), sqrt(), strcmp(), strcpy() etc.

Advantages of C library functions

1.C Library functions are easy to use and optimized for better performance.

2.C library functions save a lot of time i.e, function development time.

3.C library functions are convenient as they always work.

Example:

// C program to implement the above approach

#include <math.h>

#include <stdio.h>

 // Driver code

int main()

{

  double Number;

  Number = 49;

  // Computing the square root with the help of predefined C library function

  double squareRoot = sqrt(Number);   

  printf("The Square root of %.2lf = %.2lf", 

          Number, squareRoot);

  return 0;

}

Output:-

The Square root of 49.00 = 7.00
