User Defined Function:-Functions that the programmer creates are known as User-Defined functions or “tailor-made functions”. User-defined functions can be improved and modified according to the need of the programmer. Whenever we write a function that is case-specific and is not defined in any header file, we need to declare and define our own functions according to the syntax.

*Advantages of User-Defined Functions:-

Changeable functions can be modified as per need.

The Code of these functions is reusable in other programs.

These functions are easy to understand, debug and maintain.
