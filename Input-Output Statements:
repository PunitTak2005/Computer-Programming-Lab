Input and output (I/O) operations are essential for any program to interact with the user and the external environment. In C, you use functions like printf and scanf for formatted output and input. Learning how to use these functions effectively is critical for creating programs that can process and display information correctly.

By gaining proficiency in the C Library, preprocessor directives, and input-output statements, you'll be well-equipped to write efficient, functional, and interactive C programs. These foundational concepts are the building blocks of more complex C programming and are essential for anyone looking to become a proficient C programmer.
