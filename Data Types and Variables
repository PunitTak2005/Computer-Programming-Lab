n C programming, data types are used to define the type and size of data that a variable can hold. Data types help the compiler allocate memory and interpret data correctly. C provides a variety of data types, which can be broadly categorized into the following groups:

Basic Data Types:

int: Integer data type. Used to store whole numbers.

char: Character data type. Used to store a single character.

float: Floating-point data type. Used to store real numbers with decimal points.

double: Double precision floating-point data type. Used for more precision than float.

void: Represents the absence of a type. It's often used in function return types.

Derived Data Types:

array: A collection of elements of the same data type.

pointer: A variable that stores the memory address of another variable.

structure (struct): A composite data type that groups variables of different data types under a single name.

union: A composite data type that allows different data types to be stored in the same memory location.

enum: An enumeration data type, which consists of named integer constants.
