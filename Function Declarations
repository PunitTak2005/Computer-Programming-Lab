In a function declaration, we must provide the function name, its return type, and the number 

and type of its parameters. A function declaration tells the compiler that there is a function with 

the given name defined somewhere else in the program.

Syntax:-

return_type name_of_the_function (parameter_1, parameter_2);

The parameter name is not mandatory while declaring functions. We can also declare the 

function without using the name of the data variables.

Example

int sum(int a, int b);

int sum(int , int);

Function Declaration

Note: A function in C must always be declared globally before calling it.
