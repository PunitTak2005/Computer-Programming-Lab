break Statement: The break statement is used to exit the innermost loop or switch statement. It is often used to terminate loops prematurely.

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {

    if (i == 5) {

        break; // Exit the loop when i is 5

    }

Example:- 

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

    for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {

        if (i == 3) {

            break; // Exit the loop when i is 3

        }

        printf("%d\n", i);

    }

    return 0;

}

Output:

1

2

In this example, the break statement is used to exit the loop when i is equal to 3, so only 1 and 2 are printed.
