# Switch Statement: 
The switch statement is used for multi-way 

branching. It allows you to select one of several code blocks to 

execute based on the value of an expression.



switch (expression) {

    case value1:

        // Code to execute for value1

        break;

    case value2:

        // Code to execute for value2

        break;

    // 

    default:

        // Code to execute if no match is found

}

Example:-

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

    char operator;

    double num1, num2, result;

    // Prompt the user to enter an operator and two numbers

    printf("Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): ");

    scanf(" %c", &operator);

    printf("Enter two numbers: ");

    scanf("%lf %lf", &num1, &num2);

    // Using a switch statement to perform the operation

    switch (operator) {

        case '+':

            result = num1 + num2;

            break;

        case '-':

            result = num1 - num2;

            break;

        case '*':

            result = num1 * num2;

            break;

        case '/':

            if (num2 != 0) {

                result = num1 / num2;

            } else {

                printf("Division by zero is not allowed.\n");

                return 1; // Exit the program with an error code

            }

            break;

        default:

            printf("Invalid operator.\n");

            return 1; // Exit the program with an error code

    }

    printf("Result: %.2lf\n", result);

    return 0;

}

In this program, we use a switch statement to perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) based on the operator entered by the user. The switch statement allows us to choose the appropriate operation based on the operator input
