#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

    int count = 1;

    printf("Counting from 1 to 5 using a while loop:\n");

    while (count <= 5) {

        printf("%d\n", count);

        count++;

    }

    return 0;

}



In this program, we use a while loop to count from 1 to 5. The loop continues as long as the condition count <= 5 is true.
