return Statement: The return statement is used to exit a function and return a value. It can also be used to exit the main function, which indicates the successful or unsuccessful execution of the program. It can also be used to terminate a program's execution.

int add(int a, int b) {

    return a + b; // Return the  sum of a and b

}

Example:-

#include <stdio.h>

int add(int a, int b) {

    return a + b;

}

int main() {

    int result = add(3, 4);

    printf("The result is %d\n", result);

    return 0; // Indicates successful program execution

}

Output:

The result is 7

In this example, the return statement is used to exit the main function, and 0 is returned to the operating system, indicating successful program execution.

These control statements are essential for writing C programs that perform different tasks based on various conditions and requirements.
