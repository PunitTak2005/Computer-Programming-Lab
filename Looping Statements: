for Loop: The for loop is used to execute a block of code a specific number of times. It typically consists of initialization, condition, and increment/decrement expressions.

for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {

    // Code to execute repeatedly

}

while Loop: The while loop executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

while (condition) {

    // Code to execute while the condition is true

}

do...while Loop: The do...while loop is similar to the while loop 

but ensures that the block of code is executed at least once 

before checking the condition.



do {

    // Code to execute at least once

} while (condition);
