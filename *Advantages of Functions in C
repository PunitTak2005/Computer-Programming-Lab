*Advantages of Functions in C

1) The function can reduce the repetition of the same statements in the program.

2) The function makes code readable by providing modularity to our program.

3) There is no fixed number of calling functions it can be called as many times as you want.

4) The function reduces the size of the program.

5)Once the function is declared you can just use it without thinking about the internal working of the function.
